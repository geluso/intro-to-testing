# Database Testing

## Objectives
* Write tests that interact with databases.
* Use test driven development to model database interactions.
* Create a test database that resets when tests run.

Simply querying a database for the right information can be tricky. Adding
new information to a database can be even trickier. Adding information in
a database while maintaining foreign key relationships can be the trickiest
thing of all!

**Test Driven Development**, and **Unit Tests** can help us decide how we want
to interact with our database and make sure that we're interacting with it
properly.

Database tests can be written without any front-end code, and without any
back-end code. It's good to eliminate everything besides the database
code itself. If a test fails then we'll know there's something wrong with
just our database code and we won't waste time debugging front-end or back-end
code.

# Database Scripting
Let's practice writing scripts that interact with the database without front-end
or back-end code.

Define a model for a simple database that tracks students names and their
grades.

* Name the database `school`
* Create a model called `grade`
* add a column named `name` of type string
* add a column named `grade` of type integer

### Create Project Structure
```
mkdir school-db
cd school-db
npm install --save pg sequelize
createdb school
createdb school_test
sequelize init
```

### Configure Database
Configure the database to point to the `school` database in development and a
database called `school_test` in the test section. Remove the `"production"`
section in the configuration. Your computer is probably configured to have no
username or password for your local database, so remove the username and password
fields too.

**config/config.json**:
```
{
  "development": {
    "database": "school",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  },
  "test": {
    "database": "school_test",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  }
}
```

### Create Database Model
Now create a Sequelize model where we can keep each grade. Be sure to run the
database migration after the model is created.

```
sequelize model:create --name grade --attributes name:text,grade:integer
sequelize db:migrate
```

Change your NODE_ENV to `test` and migrate the database again.

```
export NODE_ENV=test
sequelize db:migrate
```

# Create A Music Database with Foreign Key Relationships
Dealing with foreign keys in a database can be tricky. It's easy to forget
exactly how to interact with the database, especially when using a tool like
Sequelize that adds a whole new set of commands to remember.

Let's write a simple script outside of a website and server that tests just
creating foreign key relationships so we can make sure we're doing that right.

Make a database with three tables:

* **Artist** artist_id, name
* **Album** album_id, artist_id, title
* **Song** song_id, album_id, title

```
mkdir music
cd music
npm install --save pg sequelize
createdb music
createdb music_test
sequelize init
```

Edit the `config/config.json` file so it points to the `music` and `music_test`
databases.

```
{
  "development": {
    "database": "music",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  },
  "test": {
    "database": "music_test",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "postgres"
  }
}
```

### Create Models
Create models for **Artist**, **Album** and **Song**, manually configure their
`hasMany` and `belongsTo` associations. Finally, run the migration.

```
sequelize model:create --name artist --attributes name:string
sequelize model:create --name album --attributes title:string,artistId:integer
sequelize model:create --name song --attributes title:string,albumId:integer
sequelize db:migrate
```

**models/artist.js**
```js
associate: function(models) {
  // associations can be defined here
  models.artist.hasMany(models.album);
}
```

**models/album.js**
```js
associate: function(models) {
  // associations can be defined here
  models.album.belongsTo(models.artist);
  models.album.hasMany(models.song);
}
```

**models/song.js**
```js
associate: function(models) {
  // associations can be defined here
  models.song.belongsTo(models.album);
}
```

### Create Simple Script
Create a new directory called `scripts` and make a file there called
`create-song.js`.

```
mkdir scripts
touch scripts/create-song.js
```

**scripts/create-song.js**
```js
!INCLUDE "../scripts/create-song.js"
```
